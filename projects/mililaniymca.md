The Miliani YMCA 5K Fun Run is an event where people run with the purpose of raising money for the YMCA financial assistance fund, which supports indivduals and families who aren't financially able to use YMCA programs. 

At the start of the event we help people get organized by getting their number, and starting positions. Once the runners start we cheer them on and get started on arranging the activities for when they end the race. Towards the end, we once again encourge them and hand out water bottles. In my case, I gave them a nice thumbs up and handed them the water bottles as they either ran by or stopped for me. Once a majority of the runners and have arrived back and catched their breath, they could start engaging in the activites. I was in charge of the photobooth where I assisted the runners in getting their picture. I helped by making sure they were in frame, and visible as it was a particularly sunny day.

From this experience, I was able slighty develop my leadership skills due in part with help of the organization of the whole event and with assistance of taking photos.
