“Quality is more important than quantity. One home run is much better than two doubles.” – Steve Jobs

## Why bother with framework?
Since we learned HTML and CSS to help us build static webpages why would need to learn a framework? Wouldn't it be better to invest our time into learning more about HTML and CSS? With enough time we can create everything that a framwork already contains such as, navbars, forms, buttons, etc. Well thats The Thing:

We could make it, but why waste our time when its already provided by a framework. This is especially apparent when we have to make all these elements for a webpage it becomes hard to keep track of all of them and have a consistent design for the elements and the page itself. In addition, it makes it easier to maintain the code in the future. With that being said, there are many frameworks that it becomes similar to learning new programming langauges, but that can be overwhelming so where do we start? 

## Bootstrap: ?
Out of all the frameworks we probably haven't touched or heard about yet, why use Bootstrap? Well for one, it seems to be more beginner friendly option for people like us who just learned basic HTML and CSS. It has premade components like buttons, forms, nav bars, etc. and its not like we are restricted to the default design either as we can customize them just from the HTML file alone. What I mean by this is that when we create the componenets we usually specify the class and within the class we can customize things like margins and padding without touching the CSS. But, if need our components need more customizing beyond what is given by Bootstrap we could always go to the CSS file and customize it there. What I'm trying to get across is that while Bootstrap gives us the ingredients to cook with, we aren't limited to the things they provide as we could always switch them out.

## My Experience with Bootstrap
So far I've made three webpages with Bootstrap, those being: Island Snow, Gyu-Kaku, and Muphy's Bar and Grill. 

I started with Island Snow as it was an assignment for us to get used to the toolset of Bootstrap like building navbars, and the grid system. From that experience the webpage was built purely from Bootstarp in the index file from changing the color of text, to the color of the navbar and footer, I did not need to touch the CSS file to customize anything as it was a simple recreation of the webpage. 

This is my attempt at recreating the Island Snow webpage:

The next webpage, Gyu-Kaku, was based on our choice to recreate any wabpage that we could using Bootstrap, assuming the webpage we were recreating did not already use Bootstrap. I chose the Gyu-Kaku website as I was hungry and that had a nice but simple looking website that I beileve I could recreate. And for the most part I could. Where I struggle was creating it to look exactly like the orignial which was proving more difficult than initally thought. For starters I wasted most of my time attempting to use the same fonts as the original, when I couldn't as they were not open source or avaliable on Google Fonts. Then, I tried to create a navbar without looking at the Bootstrap documentation as if I knew better than it, which was another mistake as I ran into many problems like it not scaling with the size of the window, collapsing into a dropdown when the window was small, etc. And while I finished with a working page, I did not manage to fix the things I mentioned prevoiusly as I though it would be okay, but in the future it would not be as like with coding we should always expect users to not always do things we want. 

Here is what the end result looked like:

That is why for the last webpage I made also followed the ideology I had with the Gyu-Kaku website as I did not learn my lesson. One of the problems I ran into was similar to the prevoius webpage which is the navbar and in addition, the footer, were not full width so both of their ends respectivly did not touch the edge of the webpage
